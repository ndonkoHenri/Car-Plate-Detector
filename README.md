# Car Plate Detector
This is a Computer Vision Program made to detect Car-Plates in an image, Video or in real-time(ex: Webcam)!
Very Interesting right? :)

# The Algorithm || How it works?  
You might ask yourself how precisely does this great tool work...?
An Algorithm is the simplest and understandable way to represent a program.

Have a look o_o:

 - It receives an image, video or real-time Capture(ex: Webcam);
- Using the OpenCV python library and a HaarCascade file, it scans through the given objects(image or webcam), searching for one thing ~ Car Plates;
- When detected, it the returns the position in the actual frame;
- A bounding box is then drawn around this detected Car Plate and a text("Plate") is written above it.

# Why use this Program amongst all out there?
Being completely sincere, I will tell you some of the top reasons for you to use this program...

 - Two Programs available to avoid confusion: One made only for Images and the other for Real-Time Captures;
 - In the Program only for images:
	 - Several Images(of any image format) could be inputed at ones just by
   adding their different paths in the `all_images` list variable;
    - When runned, two distinct sections are seen, one for the Original Images and beneath it images showing only the Plates(Zoomed/Cropped);
 - Trackbars made available, for extreme Precision;
 - Our Formatting and Syntax respect the Python code styling rules;
 - Comments all over the programs, to ease understanding of the code;
 - Try it out to find more interesting features(ex: speed) and let me know...


Thanks for using my Programs!! :-)
